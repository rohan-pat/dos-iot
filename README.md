We created a distributed Internet of Things device driver using Cloud-Edge-Beneath Architecture. The device driver was created for XINU operating system and Beagle Bone Black. The objective of this project was to create an energy efficient driver which would communicate with the cloud through the edge. For achieving higher energy efficiency, we allowed the user to control the sampling rate and ensured that the sensor was powered on only when required. This meant examining all the interactions between the Beagle Bone and the Temperature sensor and critically evaluating which instructions were required. The device("Thing") connected to the cloud through a Edge computer and communicated with the cloud using JSON. The device was externalized to the cloud using REST.
